== Intro == 

The Coast Survey Development Lab PYthon (CSDLPY) library development
was initiated by NOAA's National Ocean Service.

The primary purpose of the CSDLPY stack of functions is to enable fast 
and efficient pre- and post-processing of NOAA's ESTOFS and HSOFS 
production. Since many low-level functions are very generic to ADCIRC
and to a typical ocean modeling production tasks, the idea is to 
open it up to a wider audience for use and ability to contribute.

== Design Considerations ==

1. Minimize dependencies on non-standard Python modules.
Although it is easy to install additional modules on personal systems,
it takes significant amount of time to approve and test those on the 
operational clusters. Therefore it is a requirement to keep external 
dependencies to a minimum.

2. Low-level functions need to be kept as generic as possible.
To avoid code duplication, and to achieve wider application, the codes
should be kept neat and generic as much as possible.

3. Application codes are separate from the main CSDLPY stack.
The stack is to be maintained as a separate entity from the CSDLPY-based
applications.

4. Tests provided with CSDLPY stack rely on web-available data files.
Tests are to validate the installation and functionality of the stack.

5. Data files for applications are provided with said applications.

6. Base Python version is 2.7.13. 
There is no provision for supporting Python 3 at this time.

7. CSDLPY stack to be self-sufficient package, with potential to install
through pip.

8. Major library upgrades are to be synced with major updates of the 
operational products/applications that rely on CSDLPY.
